# Book_Search_Engine

Description: For this project, I am making a search engine for books. I received starter code for this project, but had to make modifications to the code in order for it to be functional. In order to use the application, users will click the login/Signup link and then create an account or log in. Then they will be able to search through for a book of their choice by title. The API will help serve them up results for their search. Users will then be able to add the books of thei choice to a list that they can view at any time.

For this project, I did not have any starter code or copy any code from other projects or repositories. However, I did receive help from a tutor named Joem. I was having issues with the login and signup functionalities and he was able to help me reslove these issues. Now, users are able to create accounts and interact with the site. The other main issue that I was having was that I was unable to allow users to save books. However with the help of the tutor I was able to get this feature working.
